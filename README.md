# home_system_simple

## Purpose

This project can be seen as a "hello world" sandbox, to test a modular architecture.

## Project contents

For now, all files are not useful.

- A component is defined in component.py
- The file actuasensor.py defines a subclass of component that can interact with the house
- The system.py file defines the house with a temperature
- The ctrl_system.py defines a control system, which encapsulate several components.
- The ai_system.py defines the AI component which is part of a module.
- The scripts.py file is the main file, to set up and run a small example.
